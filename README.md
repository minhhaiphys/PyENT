# PyENT
Python version of FourmiLab's [ENT](http://www.fourmilab.ch/random/): Benchmarking suite for pseudorandom number sequence.

### Tests

* Entropy
* Chi-square
* Arithmetic mean versus Median
* Monte-Carlo value for Pi
* Serial correlation coefficient

### Usage

Convenient functions can be found in ```src/pyent.py```.

**Running from Terminal/Command line:**
Run ```python pyent.py <list of file names>```. The program will read each file in binary format, convert the contents to an array of bytes then perform the tests.
Result will look like this (data are randomly generated by ```numpy.random```):

```
Entropy =  6.999069177508394 bits per character.
Optimum compression would reduce the size of this data by 0 percent.

Chi square distribution is 1.36e+02, and randomly would exceed this value 27.2 percent of the times.

Arithmetic mean value is 5.00e-01
Median value is 5.00e-01

Monte-Carlo value for Pi is 3.132711327113271 (error 0.283 percent)
Serial correlation coefficient is 0.0015527534224932795
```
